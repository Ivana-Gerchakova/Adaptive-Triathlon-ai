# Adaptive Triathlon Interface Based on Emotion Detection 🧠💪 

This project is developed as part of the subject **Advanced Interactive Technologies**. It demonstrates an **adaptive user interface** that responds to real-time **facial emotion detection** using the user's webcam. 
Based on the detected emotion, the interface dynamically updates its content to motivate and guide triathletes through personalized workouts, tips, and music.

---

## 🎯 What It Does

The web application uses `face-api.js` to detect the user’s facial expressions (`happy`, `sad`, `neutral`) and updates the UI accordingly with:

- 🎽 Personalized triathlon training plans (🏊 swim, 🚴 bike, 🏃 run)
- 🎵 Music suggestions and playlists (via embedded YouTube links)
- 💬 Motivational quotes and tips tailored to the mood
- 🎨 Dynamic background and visuals to match the emotion

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`
- [`face-api.js`](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js) (TensorFlow.js wrapper for face detection and expressions)
- YouTube embedded video links
- Webcam video stream (via `navigator.mediaDevices`)
- Local hosting via **Live Server** in Visual Studio Code
